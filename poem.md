- Once upon a time, data was read
- Transformed into something, mapped
- Filtered by a predicated, ordered
- Even parallelized, but not finalized
- And when a finalizer came, it was dead


- Data once alive
- Shaped, mapped, filtered through its paths—
- Parallel in flight
- Yet no end would call its name
- And the final call found none
